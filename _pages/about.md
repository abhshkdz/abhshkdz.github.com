![cover](/img/cover.jpg)

As of Fall 2016, I am a graduate student at Virginia Tech advised by [Prof. Dhruv Batra][2] and a member of the [Machine Learning and Perception Lab][1].
I will soon be transferring to Georgia Institute of Technology following my advisor's [move][32].

My research interests focus on the development of deep learning models and its applications in computer vision and natural language processing.
A PDF version of my CV is available [here][33].

Prior to joining Virginia Tech, I had the privilege of collaborating with 
[Prof. Geoffrey Goodhill][4] and [Lilach Avitan][5] (postdoctoral
research fellow) at the [Goodhill Lab][6], Queensland Brain Institute,
where I studied how neural activity represents spatial information
in the visual system, and analyzed neuron-dropping (dependency of
neural decoding on number of recorded neurons).

A significant portion of my motivation to study deep learning
comes from the loose analogies between machine learning concepts and 
their neuroscientific counterparts, such as Dropout (regularization)
and redundancy in neural activity, high-level information representation
by a deep convolutional network and neural spiking activity.
My long-term goal is to have a better understanding
of how the brain works and use that knowledge and underlying
principles to build artificial intelligence.

I graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee][31] in 2015
with a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering. Through the course of my
undergrad, I've been fortunate to have participated in the
Google Summer of Code program in [2013][8] and [2014][9],
won several hackathons and security contests ([Yahoo! HackU!][10], 
[Microsoft Code.Fun.Do.][11], Deloitte CCTC [2013][12] and [2014][13]),
served as a [Google Student Ambassador][14] and organized our institute's
first hackathon [Syntax Error][15], and been an active member of [SDSLabs][16].

On the side, I built and continue to help maintain [Erdős][17],
a competitive learning platform for math geeks, and a bunch of
other projects ([aideadlin.es][34], [neural-vqa][19], [HackFlowy][20], [graf][21], [etc][22]).
I often [tweet][23], and post pictures from my wanderings
on [Instagram][24] and [Tumblr][25].
